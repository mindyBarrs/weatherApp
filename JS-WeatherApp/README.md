# Weather Javascript App

It is an application that loads on a webpage and then it will ask permission to get your location.
Once it has the location info it will use an API to get the local wather information and
display the tempature and the weather condition. Also if you click on the Celsius icon it will change
the tempatures to Farenheit, and vice versus.

The application was originally created on codepen.io

## Technologies Used

### Note:
