The application will allow the user either use thier current location or enter in a location they would like to know the currect weather. The applicaiton will provide the latlong to [weaterAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/) which will then return the location's currect weather information.

The weather application has a number of interation:

- JS-WeatherApp: created with vanilla javascript
- React-WeatherApp: created with react and used a node server to retrieve data from the api
- Vue-WeatherApp: created using vue and used the same node server as the react app to retrieve data from the api.

A node server was created to be used by the React and Vue applications to retrieve the weather data from [weaterAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/).
